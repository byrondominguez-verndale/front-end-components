# Masthead
This component has 3 different variations on the image (right, left and full background)

## Usage
Add the front-end-copmonent library to your project
```bash
yarn add @verndale/front-end-components
```

Copy and paste to your project any of the markup in the masthead variations - you can find the markup in the **HTML tab**.

## Styling
The component will already have a default style/theme set, so it will work out of the box.
The masthead has a set of variables that may be overriden, or you may choose to just override the actual styles in your project.
It is recommended to use the overrides if you can as it will be less code in your project.

Below is the list of variables you can override. You may also find these in the **Assets tab** under `_variables.scss`
```scss
